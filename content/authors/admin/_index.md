I'm a graduate student interested in particle phenomenology and physics education. I spent two years in the UK as a Marshall scholar, and am currently a PhD student at Stanford, funded by an NSF Graduate Research fellowship. A complete CV is available {{% staticref "other/CV.pdf" "newtab" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}. 

I got started by devouring the scifi section of my local public library, but it wasn't until watching *Particle Fever* in college that I knew what I wanted to be. I find nothing more thrilling than the process of scientific discovery, whether it's the "aha!" moment of a single student or the collective effort of the entire physics community, and I hope to be a lifelong participant as a professor of physics.
