I'm a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley and LBNL, working at the Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics. I am primarily interested in accelerating the discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model through new kinds of precision experiments. Many of these ideas focus on detecting ultralight dark matter, though I've also thought about more radical possibilities, such as modifications of long-range forces due to continuous spin. A complete CV is available {{% staticref "other/CV.pdf" "newtab" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}. 

Previously, I earned my PhD degree at Stanford in 2024, and Master's degrees at Cambridge and Oxford. During that period I spent a lot of energy on physics education and outreach, and I'm still always interested in hearing a good physics puzzle.
