### Expository

- {{% staticref "writing/Relaxation.pdf" "newtab" %}}Cosmological Relaxation{{% /staticref %}}. A dissertation written for the Oxford MSc in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics, covering models that "relax" the Higgs boson's mass. Also contains unqualified musings on model building and the meaning of naturalness and fine-tuning.
- {{% staticref "writing/Demuth.pdf" "newtab" %}}The Meaning of Nothing{{% /staticref %}}. The New College Demuth prize essay, on how theoretical stories map onto reality, and why a physicist's philosophical flexibility is a useful tool.

I like to read longform articles, and maintain lists of memorable ones about [science]({{<ref "science">}}) and [everything else]({{<ref "articles">}}). I'm also active on [Physics StackExchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/83398/knzhou), where my answers have almost 2 million views; you can find a sample [here]({{<ref "answers">}}).
