These are the notes I've taken while learning physics. They're quite compact and don't usually correspond closely with any particular course; instead they're packed full of all the neat things I've found reading books. Currently they weigh in at 1,900 pages and 750,000 words.

### Basics

These notes summarize foundational material. They roughly cover both the MIT undergraduate sequence and Part I and II of the Cambridge physics sequence.

### Breadth

These notes give a little bit of background on a wide variety of fields of physics, and are aimed at the late undergraduate level.

### Depth

These notes focus on my own field of particle physics, following courses taught at Cambridge's Part III and Oxford's MMathPhys.
