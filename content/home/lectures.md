These are the notes I've taken while learning physics. They're very compact and don't usually correspond closely with any particular course; instead they're packed full of all the neat things I've found reading books. Currently they weigh in at just over 400,000 words. 

### Undergraduate (MIT) 

These notes summarize undergraduate material. They roughly cover both the MIT undergraduate sequence and Part I and II of the Cambridge physics sequence.
