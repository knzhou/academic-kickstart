These are some notes I've taken while learning physics. Nothing in them is original; everything is aggregated from many sources. These notes are very terse and provided "as is", with no guarantee of correctness, but do tell me if you find an error!

#### Undergraduate (MIT) 

I wrote these notes to summarize foundational undergraduate material. They roughly follow both the MIT undergraduate sequence and Part I and II of the Cambridge physics sequence. 

- {{% staticref "notes/phy.pdf" "newtab" %}}Undergraduate Physics{{% /staticref %}} [8.01--8.09]
- {{% staticref "notes/mat.pdf" "newtab" %}}Undergraduate Math{{% /staticref %}} [18.01--18.100]
- {{% staticref "notes/gt.pdf" "newtab" %}}Geometry and Topology{{% /staticref %}} [summer 2016 seminar]
- Solid State Physics [8.231]

#### Part III (Cambridge) 

These notes for Part III Maths courses follow the lectures loosely, including a substantial amount of extra material.

- {{% staticref "notes/grp.pdf" "newtab" %}}Group Theory{{% /staticref %}} [SFP]
- {{% staticref "notes/sft.pdf" "newtab" %}}Statistical Field Theory{{% /staticref %}}
- {{% staticref "notes/gr.pdf" "newtab" %}}General Relativity{{% /staticref %}}
- {{% staticref "notes/qft.pdf" "newtab" %}}Quantum Field Theory{{% /staticref %}} [QFT, AQFT]
- {{% staticref "notes/sm.pdf" "newtab" %}}Standard Model{{% /staticref %}} [SM, BSM]
- {{% staticref "notes/susy.pdf" "newtab" %}}Supersymmetry{{% /staticref %}}

#### MMathPhys (Oxford)

These notes for the MMathPhys course are currently in progress. 

- Topological Quantum Mechanics
- Cosmology
- Solitons
- Condensed Matter [Advanced Quantum Theory, Quantum Matter]
- Conformal Field Theory
- String Theory
