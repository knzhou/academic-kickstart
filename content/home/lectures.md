These are the notes I've taken while learning physics. They're very compact and don't usually correspond closely with any particular course; instead they're packed full of all the neat things I've found reading books. Currently they weigh in at 1,750 pages and 650,000 words. 

### Basics

These notes summarize foundational material. They roughly cover both the MIT undergraduate sequence and Part I and II of the Cambridge physics sequence.

### Breadth

These notes give a little bit of background on a wide variety of fields, and are aimed at the late undergraduate level.

- Astrophysics
- Quantum Computation

- {{% staticref "notes/sld.pdf" "newtab" %}}Solid State Physics{{% /staticref %}}
- Condensed Matter

### Depth

These notes focus on my own field of particle physics, following courses taught at Cambridge's Part III and Oxford's MMathPhys.
