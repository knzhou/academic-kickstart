These are some notes I've taken while learning physics. They're very compact and don't usually correspond closely with any particular course; instead they're packed full of all the neat things I've found reading books.

#### Undergraduate (MIT) 

These notes summarize undergraduate material. They roughly cover both the MIT undergraduate sequence and Part I and II of the Cambridge physics sequence.

#### Master's (Cambridge, Oxford)

I took these notes during a two year Marshall scholarship in the UK, at Cambridge's Part III and Oxford's MMathPhys. The notes here generally blend the two together.
