I run a small tutoring program for students aiming for gold medals at the IPhO. Students receive weekly handouts with about 30 questions, which are discussed in an hour long, one-on-one online meeting. At the end of the year, there are also several graded practice USAPhOs and review sessions. The learning is self-driven: instead of having me lecture at you, you'll try the problems and we'll discuss your attempts and solutions. 

The core curriculum is 24 units long, though students can choose any subset or order they wish. The typical time commitment is 8--12 hours per week. For details, see the {{% staticref "tutoring/Syllabus.pdf" "newtab" %}}syllabus{{% /staticref %}}. 

The tutoring program is pitched at a high level; for context, see the problem sets for {{% staticref "tutoring/P1.pdf" "newtab" %}}Problem Solving I{{% /staticref %}}, {{% staticref "tutoring/M4.pdf" "newtab" %}}Mechanics IV{{% /staticref %}}, {{% staticref "tutoring/E5.pdf" "newtab" %}}Electromagnetism V{{% /staticref %}}, and {{% staticref "tutoring/T2.pdf" "newtab" %}}Thermodynamics II{{% /staticref %}}. I expect students to be comfortable with calculus-based physics and with qualifying for the USAPhO. I don't offer more introductory training; for that, consider the [F=ma](https://artofproblemsolving.com/school/course/fma) and [PhysicsWOOT](https://artofproblemsolving.com/school/woot-physics) programs by Art of Problem Solving. Another good resource is *Physics* (5th edition) by Halliday, Resnick, and Krane.

For more details, such as how to apply, see the {{% staticref "tutoring/FAQ.pdf" "newtab" %}}FAQ{{% /staticref %}}. Personally, my main motivation for running this program was to develop a comprehensive problem solving curriculum, with the help of enthusiastic students and teaching assistants. The 2021--2022 academic year is the last year this program will run; in the year after that, the finished materials will be released for free.
