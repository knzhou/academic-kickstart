I offer tutoring for the USA Physics Olympiad (USAPhO) and the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO). I competed at the IPhO in [2012](https://ipho-unofficial.org/timeline/2012/individual) and [2013](https://ipho-unofficial.org/timeline/2013/individual) and taught at the US Physics Team training camp in 2015 through 2017.

The tutoring program is designed for students aiming for gold medals at the USAPhO or IPhO. It is based on learning by problem solving. During the training, students receive weekly handouts containing about 30 questions, which are discussed at an online meeting. At the end of the year, there are also several graded practice USAPhOs and review sessions. Most of the learning is self-driven: rather than lecturing at you, I will typically give a short introduction to each problem set and refer you to relevant textbook chapters to read on your own. 

The full curriculum is about 30 weeks long, though students can choose any subset or order they wish. The typical time commitment is 8--15 hours per week. For details, see the {{% staticref "tutoring/Syllabus.pdf" "newtab" %}}syllabus{{% /staticref %}}. 

The tutoring program is pitched at a high level; for context, see the problem sets for {{% staticref "tutoring/M4.pdf" "newtab" %}}Mechanics IV{{% /staticref %}} and {{% staticref "tutoring/E5.pdf" "newtab" %}}Electromagnetism V{{% /staticref %}}. I expect students to be comfortable with calculus-based mechanics and electromagnetism, and with qualifying for the USAPhO. For more introductory training, you can ask me to refer you to another tutor, or consider the [PhysicsWOOT](https://artofproblemsolving.com/school/woot-physics) program by Art of Problem Solving. Another good resource is *Physics* (5th edition) by Halliday, Resnick, and Krane.

I've already taken students for the 2019--2020 program, which will run until March. If you'd like to be considered anyway, you can fill out an application, but you'll only get a spot if somebody else drops out. For logistical details, such as how to apply, see the {{% staticref "tutoring/FAQ.pdf" "newtab" %}}FAQ{{% /staticref %}}.
