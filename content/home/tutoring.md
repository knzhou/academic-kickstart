I offer tutoring for the USA Physics Olympiad (USAPhO) and the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO). I competed at the IPhO in [2012](https://ipho-unofficial.org/timeline/2012/individual) and [2013](https://ipho-unofficial.org/timeline/2013/individual) and taught at the US Physics Team training camp in 2015--2017 and 2019.

The tutoring program is designed for students aiming for gold medals at the USAPhO or IPhO. During the training, students receive weekly handouts with about 30 questions, which are discussed at an online meeting. At the end of the year, there are also several graded practice USAPhOs and review sessions. The learning is self-driven: instead of having me lecture at you, you'll try the problems and we'll discuss your attempts and solutions. 

The core curriculum is 24 units long, though students can choose any subset or order they wish. The typical time commitment is 8--12 hours per week. For details, see the {{% staticref "tutoring/Syllabus.pdf" "newtab" %}}syllabus{{% /staticref %}}. 

The tutoring program is pitched at a high level; for context, see the problem sets for {{% staticref "tutoring/P1.pdf" "newtab" %}}Problem Solving I{{% /staticref %}}, {{% staticref "tutoring/M4.pdf" "newtab" %}}Mechanics IV{{% /staticref %}}, {{% staticref "tutoring/E5.pdf" "newtab" %}}Electromagnetism V{{% /staticref %}}, and {{% staticref "tutoring/T2.pdf" "newtab" %}}Thermodynamics II{{% /staticref %}}. I expect students to be comfortable with calculus-based physics and with qualifying for the USAPhO. I don't offer more introductory training, but you can ask me to refer you to another tutor, or consider the [PhysicsWOOT](https://artofproblemsolving.com/school/woot-physics) program by Art of Problem Solving. Another good resource is *Physics* (5th edition) by Halliday, Resnick, and Krane.
