Here are some articles about how we got here, how it's going, and what it looks like on the ground. They are all nontechnical; good technical articles are linked in my {{% staticref "/#lectures" %}}lecture notes{{% /staticref %}}. Regarding the quit lit, I believe that everybody should read some before committing to graduate school, but it needs to be taken with a grain of salt.
